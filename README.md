#SurveyGizmo Tools

I have been using SurveyGizmo since the middle of 2014. One night I was working on a script and I thought "What the hell am I doing re-creating something I have already built!". So with that I figured I would start documenting my scripts and processes and share them with fellow co-workers and other SurveyGizmo developers out there that have faced similar struggles in SurveyGizmo.
